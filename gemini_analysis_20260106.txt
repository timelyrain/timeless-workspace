🧠 CIO INTERPRETATION (Gemini)
📅 Jan 06, 2026

💭 Overall, a "B" read.

📊 SCORE QUALITY
T1: 48/50 (96%) STRONG
T2: 27/30 (90%) STRONG
T3: 4/15 (27%) WEAK
T4: 1.8/5 (36%) WEAK

👁️ WHAT I SEE
✅ Credit markets solid (HY 2.83%). Breadth confirms rally (% > 50MA is 66%).
⚠️ Risk appetite is GONE (sector rot -0.46%). VIX backwardation started (3.1% near-term premium).

🎯 MARKET REGIME
Tier 1 is holding up the entire show. Tier 3 imploding as institutions buy protection. This is a *late cycle* market – be tactical.

💡 MY CALL
System: 60/30/5/5
Suggest: 50/30/15/5
Stops: 2-3%
Why: Protect profits given market undercurrents; rotate into quality.

🔄 FLIP TRIGGERS
→ VIX backwardation continues for 3 more days.
→ HY spread > 3.5%.

⚡ BOTTOM LINE
Cautious. Trim active trades given institutional hedging.
