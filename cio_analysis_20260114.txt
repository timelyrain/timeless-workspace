🧠 CIO INTERPRETATION (Claude)
📅 Jan 14, 2026

💭 HEADLINE
Strong foundation cracking at the edges - institutions quietly buying protection

📊 SCORE QUALITY
T1: 48/50 (96%) STRONG
T2: 27/30 (90%) STRONG
T3: 4/15 (27%) WEAK
T4: 2/5 (36%) WEAK

👁️ WHAT I SEE
✅ HY spreads tight at 2.74%, TED at 0.09 - credit markets purring
✅ 61% above 50MA, only 28% below 200MA - breadth solid
⚠️ VIX backwardation active - smart money hedging at 3.2% premium
⚠️ Fear/Greed at 86 screaming euphoria, sector rotation dead

🎯 MARKET REGIME
Classic late-cycle setup. Credit/liquidity pristine, breadth confirming, but institutions buying puts while retail parties. VIX calm at 15.7 but structure warns of coming volatility.

💡 MY CALL
System: 60/30/5/5
Run the playbook.
Watch backwardation closely - Day 0 is just a whisper.

🔄 FLIP TRIGGERS
→ Backwardation Day 3+ or VIX >20
→ HY spreads >3.5% or TED >0.3

⚡ BOTTOM LINE
Deployed but on high alert - smart money is hedging for a reason.
