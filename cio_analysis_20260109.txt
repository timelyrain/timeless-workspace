🧠 CIO INTERPRETATION (Claude)
📅 Jan 09, 2026

💭 HEADLINE
Credit's bulletproof but institutions quietly buying hedges - mixed signals brewing

📊 SCORE QUALITY
T1: 48/50 (96%) STRONG
T2: 27/30 (90%) STRONG  
T3: 5/15 (33%) WEAK
T4: 2/5 (36%) WEAK

👁️ WHAT I SEE
✅ HY spreads tight at 2.79%, TED at 0.09 (banking solid)
✅ 71% above 50-MA, only 27% below 200-MA (breadth healthy)
✅ A/D line confirming the move up

⚠️ VIX backwardation active - institutions paying 3.5% premium for protection
⚠️ Fear/Greed at 85.8 (extreme greed territory)
⚠️ Risk appetite scores tanking (33%)

🎯 MARKET REGIME
Classic late-cycle setup. Credit markets don't care, retail euphoric, but smart money hedging. Score's solid at 81.8 but built on shaky foundation - Tier 3/4 screaming caution while fundamentals hold.

💡 MY CALL
System: 60/30/5/5
Run the playbook but watch that backwardation like a hawk.

🔄 FLIP TRIGGERS
→ Backwardation hits Day 3+ 
→ HY spreads break 3.5%

⚡ BOTTOM LINE
Deployed but ready to pivot - credit says party, institutions buying insurance.
