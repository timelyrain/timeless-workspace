🧠 CIO INTERPRETATION (Gemini)
📅 Jan 14, 2026

💭 Optimism waning, but not time to panic (yet).

📊 SCORE QUALITY
T1: 48/50 (96%) STRONG
T2: 27/30 (90%) STRONG
T3: 4/15 (27%) WEAK
T4: 1.8/5 (36%) WEAK

👁️ WHAT I SEE
✅ HY spreads tight at 2.74%
✅ Breadth still strong; 61% above 50-MA
⚠️ Risk appetite cratering, sector rot -0.94%
⚠️ VIX backwardation starting

🎯 MARKET REGIME
Late-cycle vibes intensifying. Strong liquidity/breadth masks deteriorating risk appetite. Institutions starting to hedge, but conviction low (Day 0 backwardation).

💡 MY CALL
System: 60/30/5/5
Suggest: 55/30/10/5
Stops: -2% to -3% on active
Why: Fade sector rot into gold, add cash.

🔄 FLIP TRIGGERS
→ HY spread > 3.5%
→ VIX backwardation Day 3+

⚡ BOTTOM LINE
Becoming cautious, dial up defense given waning risk appetite despite strong underlying credit.
